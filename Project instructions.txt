This file will contain the instructions on setting up the VM to begin development
on your very first go project.

Which also happens to be a full fledged hacking framework that you have to build yourself I guess

I mean, it's still for learning FIRST... but It has too many features to be anything else now.

With great power comes great responsibility... do good work


You shouldnt need this but these are the first steps:

    - Download latest debian stable iso.
    - Install VM in VirtualBox
    - follow instructions in project readme.md to get started developing
