the pkg dir is where individual modules, or "packages" are stored 
These are the common base of code with which you make your binaries

Each folder is its own module
    each child folder is another module, inside that module
    so each file in a folder, is going to be declared as:
    
        package {that foldername}
    
    and must be exported even higher, to be accessed in src


Shared code: The main RAT shared codebase
    
    - each function is currently being moved into it's own file
         in a subfolder for functions previously in a single file
    
    - the purpose of this is to enable the usage of build flags as
        as a way of picking and choosing code to compile, for the
        smallest binary possible, with only the functions necessary
        for the target system

R2Pipe     : A go Language Extension for interaction with Radare2
    - an automated disassembly process will be implemented for quick 
        examination of your compiled binaries for self study
